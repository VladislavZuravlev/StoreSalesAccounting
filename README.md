# StoreSalesAccounting
This project is a small online cash register for sales accounting.
I started developing it because of my friend, as he keeps records of finances in excel, and I decided to help him a little.
This project uses a local database
Functional:
- Input and output of sales (who sold, what sold, amount and method of payment)
- Output of general sales data (by day)
- Data filtering (by name, specific date or date range)
